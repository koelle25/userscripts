# Userscripts
My Userscripts for use with [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)/[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).

## ODS Stundennachweis Autofocus Input Field
So you're working as a student assistant at [Fachhochschule Dortmund](https://www.fh-dortmund.de/) and have to record your working hours in their _ODS_ system.
But when entering entries it gets more and more annoying to scroll down, click the Date field etc. everytime.

This script auto-focuses the date input field, so you can record your working hours faster and more easily.
Furthermore it modifies the `tabIndex` value of the input fields, so you can just:

"Type date" -> `TAB` -> "Type begin" -> `TAB` -> "Type end" -> `TAB` -> ENTER.  

Done, easy!

## Kicktipp Custom CSS
When using an Adblocker the Kicktipp website looks somewhat bad, especially of late.

This script inserts some custom CSS and does jiggle around a few elements so you won't longer feel the need to scratch out your eyes.
